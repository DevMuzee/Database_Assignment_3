-- USE hospital_db
-- Part 1: Basic Aggregate Functions
-- 1.1). Write a query to find the total number of patient admissions in the admissions table.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_number_of_patient_admissions
FROM admissions;

-- 1.2). Write a query to calculate the average length of stay (difference between discharge date and admission date) for all patients.
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(d.discharge_date,a.admission_date)) AS average_length_of_stay
FROM admissions AS a
JOIN discharges AS d
	ON a.admission_id=d.admission_id;
    
    
-- Part 2: Grouping Data
-- 2.1). Write a query to group admissions by primary_diagnosis and calculate the total number of admissions for each diagnosis.
SELECT primary_diagnosis, COUNT(*) AS total_no_diagnosis
FROM admissions
GROUP BY primary_diagnosis;

-- 2.2). Write a query to group admissions by service and calculate the average length of stay for each service (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology).
SELECT service, AVG(datediff(d.discharge_date, a.admission_date)) AS length_of_stay
FROM admissions AS a
JOIN discharges AS d
	ON a.admission_id=d.admission_id
GROUP BY service;
    
-- 2.3). Write a query to group discharges by discharge_disposition and count the number of discharges in each category (e.g., Home, Expired, Transfer)
SELECT discharge_disposition, COUNT(*) AS discharge_count
FROM discharges
GROUP BY discharge_disposition;

-- Part 3: Combining Aggregates and Filtering
-- 3.1). Write a query to group admissions by service and show the services where the total number of admissions is greater than 5.
SELECT service, COUNT(*) AS total_admission
FROM admissions
GROUP BY service
HAVING COUNT(*) >5;
-- 3.2). Write a query to find the average length of stay for patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of "Stroke" in the admissions table.

SELECT AVG(d.discharge_date-a.admission_date) AS average_length_of_stay
FROM admissions AS a
JOIN discharges AS d
	ON a.admission_id=d.admission_id
WHERE primary_diagnosis = 'Stroke';

-- Part 4: Advanced Grouping and Summarizing
-- 4.1). Write a query to group emergency department visits (ed_visits) by acuity and calculate the total number of visits for each acuity level.
SELECT acuity, COUNT(*) AS total_visits
FROM ed_visits
GROUP BY acuity;
-- 4.2). Write a query to group admissions by primary_diagnosis and service, showing the total number of admissions for each combination.
SELECT service, primary_diagnosis, COUNT(*) AS total_admissions
FROM admissions
GROUP BY service, primary_diagnosis;

-- Part 5: Practical Financial Analysis
-- 5.1). Write a query to group admissions by month (using the admission_date) and calculate the total number of admissions per month.
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(admission_date, '%Y-%m') AS Months, COUNT(*) AS total_number_of_admissions_per_month
FROM admissions
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(admission_date, '%Y-%m');

-- 5.2 Write a query to find the maximum length of stay for each primary_diagnosis in the admissions table.

SELECT primary_diagnosis, MAX(DATEDIFF(d.discharge_date, a.admission_date)) AS max_length_of_stay
FROM admissions AS a
JOIN discharges AS d
	ON a.admission_id=d.admission_id
GROUP BY primary_diagnosis;

-- Bonus Challenge (optional)
-- Write a query to group admissions by service and calculate both the total and average length of stay for each service, 
-- ordered by the highest average length of stay.
SELECT service, 
	SUM(datediff(d.discharge_date, a.admission_date)) AS total_length_of_stay,
    AVG(datediff(d.discharge_date, a.admission_date)) AS avg_length_of_stay
FROM admissions AS a
JOIN discharges AS d
	ON a.admission_id=d.admission_id
GROUP BY service
